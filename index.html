          <p class="fs-4 p-2 m-2 text-align-center">David Goggins was born on February 17, 1975, to Trunnis and Jackie Goggins. In 1981, Goggins lived in Williamsville, New York, with his parents and brother, Trunnis Jr. Goggins has described how, as a six year old, he worked alongside his mother and brother at his father's skate rink. Goggins has claimed that he and other members of his family suffered constant and severe abuse from his alcoholic father before escaping from him along with his mother to Brazil, Indiana, something which he talks about in the book Can't Hurt Me.</p>

          <p class="fs-4 p-2 text-align-center">When Goggins lived in Brazil as a young kid, he’d been unaware of racism. This started to change when he and his mother later moved back to Brazil from Indianapolis and he faced a slew of harassment, including being threatened at gunpoint on a rural road. He struggled to understand how people could be so hateful. He also felt the loneliness of being one of the only black people in town.

            Goggins didn’t know how to channel these emotions. He started trying to come up with ways to get a rise out of the racists around him, wearing unusual clothing, trimming his hair in odd ways, and blaring music from his car.</p>

          <p class="fs-4 p-2 m-2 text-align-center">Though Goggins was now in high school, he still relied on cheating to pass school and was reading at the 4th-grade level. He wanted to join the Air Force but didn’t realize he’d need to pass an aptitude test. He was unable to cheat, and he didn’t pass on his first attempt.

            Then, at the end of his junior year, Goggins received a letter that he wouldn’t graduate unless his attendance record and grades improved during his final year. This moment led him to a self-reckoning in his bathroom mirror. He felt frustrated with who he saw that day—a kid with few prospects who wouldn’t be able to make it into the Air Force without getting tough with himself and changing his behavior. He resolved to reach his goal of getting into the Air Force by improving his reading skills and studying for the test.
            
            Each night, he wrote his goals for the next day down on Post-it notes and placed them on the mirror, his “accountability mirror.” Then, he’d make sure he worked toward his goals each day. He’d give himself a tough talk about the steps he needed to take and why. For example, he’d call himself out for being stupid and tell himself he needed to study to fix that. He found this method more motivating than being gentle with himself.
            
            Using his accountability mirror to work toward his goals allowed Goggins to pass the Air Force qualifying exam and graduate from high school.</p>

            <p class="fs-4 p-1 text-align-center">Goggins applied to join the United States Air Force Pararescue, and was accepted into training after failing his ASVAB twice. During the training he had been diagnosed with sickle cell trait and was removed from training. He was given the option to restart the training upon his return but chose not to. He then completed United States Air Force Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) training, and worked as a TACP from 1994 until 1999, when he left the United States Air Force. After five years in service Goggins got discharged and worked in pest control. He hated his job and daily routine, he doubled his weight and got so insecure. Then one day everything changed for Goggins when he decided to join the Navy SEAL because he got sick of being haunted for being a nobody.</p>

One of the high-ups in the KKK’s son sat behind me in two classes, so he called me nigger all the time. Got my first car, they spray painted “Nigger we’re going to kill you” on it. I was weighing like 297 pounds. I was just an insecure, scared kid. I had to make a change in my life.

            “I was at a all-time low and I wasn’t going anywhere, and I was exactly what everybody said I was going to be, which is nothing. The best thing that happened to me, no one helped me. I had to figure out I wasn’t going to be a punk kid all my life. The only way I could turn it around was to suffer. I had to build calluses in my brain the same way I build calluses on my hands. I broke the Guinness Book of World Records for pullups a long time ago, but I failed at it twice. I did 67,000 pullups in trying to break this record. To do 4,030 pullups I had to do 67,000 for training for that.”
